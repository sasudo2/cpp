pointer are special type of veriable that are used to point to address of other
veriables.
syntax: datatype *veriable_name;
Array of pointer
similart to other variables we can create an array of pointers in C++. The array of pointer represents a collection of adress. By declearing array of pointers,
we can save substantial amount of memmory space.

syntax: datatype *veriable_nam[size];

Pointers to funciton:
The pointer to funciton is also known as callback function. We can use these function pointer
to refer to a function. Using funciton pointer allows a c++ program to select a
function dynamically at run time. We can also pass a function as an argument to another function.
Here, the function is passed as a pointer. The funcition pointer cannot be dereferenced.
C++ also allows us to compare two function pointers.
