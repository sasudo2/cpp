pointer are special type of veriable that are used to point to address of other
veriables.
syntax: datatype *veriable_name;
Array of pointer
similart to other variables we can create an array of pointers in C++. The array of pointer represents a collection of adress. By declearing array of pointers,
we can save substantial amount of memmory space.

syntax: datatype *veriable_nam[size];

Pointers to funciton:
The pointer to funciton is also known as callback function. We can use these function pointer
to refer to a function. Using funciton pointer allows a c++ program to select a
function dynamically at run time. We can also pass a function as an argument to another function.
Here, the function is passed as a pointer. The funcition pointer cannot be dereferenced.
C++ also allows us to compare two function pointers.


pointer to derived class:

we can use the pointer of base class to point to derived class but this pointer will only be able to
point to properties derived from base class but not the original properties defined with in the derived
class

but we can use((DC *)bptr) to cast base class pointer to derived class pointer and use it access locally defined members.
